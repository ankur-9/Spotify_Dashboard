🌟 Project Overview
Ever wondered when you listen to music the most? Which artists dominate your playlists? Or how often you skip songs? This Spotify Analysis Dashboard answers these questions—and more—by turning raw streaming data into a visually rich, interactive story.

Powered by Power BI, the dashboard uncovers:

Your top tracks, albums, and artists (and how often you replay them).
Listening patterns—peak hours, weekday vs. weekend habits, and device preferences.
Engagement metrics—skip rates, shuffle usage, and average play duration.
Whether you're a casual listener or a data-driven music enthusiast, this tool helps you understand your auditory lifestyle.
